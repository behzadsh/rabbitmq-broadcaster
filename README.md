# RabbitMQ Event Broadcaster for Laravel

The main focus of Laravel's event broadcasting module is to enable communication with the client-side of the application.
However, it can also be useful for asynchronous communication and message passing between services, especially in a
microservices architecture.

This package provides an easy way to broadcast Laravel events to a RabbitMQ server, enabling you to send messages
asynchronously and facilitating communication between services in a microservices architecture.
